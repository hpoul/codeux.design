When storing your secrets in your git repository using blackbox you need
a way to easily decrypt them on your CI. This can be a bit combersome if
you require a gpg key. In this article we look at ways on how to do this
on GitLab CI, Travis CI and CirrusCI

[TOC]

# Overview

In a previous article we explored how to 
[set up blackbox for your git repository](../manage-secrets-flutter-project) for
your flutter project. Now let's look how to actually use them in your favorite
CI.

To avoid having to set up a whole OpenGPG environment and import keys I
have created a [fork of the go implementation of blackbox][1] which implements
the command `cipostdeploy` which simply takes a private key and decrypts
all registered blackbox files in your repository.

We can easily make use of it in a CI by downloading the required
[binary from the github release][2].


# Creating a "role account"

A role account is simply a private key you can register as "admin" in 
your blackbox repository which is not a real user. But due to how blackbox
is set up you still need a full public/private key pair which is associated
with an email address.

My fork contains a [script which makes this very easy called 
blackbox_create_role_account][3] so I would recommend you either check out
the fork or simply download the script into your `$PATH`. You can also
[follow the procedure manually][4].

With the `blackbox_create_role_account` simply create one "account" for every
CI you intend to use, to make it easy to remove those accounts again.

```console
bash$ blackbox_create_role_account travis-ci@roleaccount
```

This will ask you for your password and then reencrypt all files again. You
should see the added role account when listing all admins:

```console
bash$ blackbox_listadmins 
authpass-ci-cirrus-key@codeux.design
herbert@poul.at
travis-ci@roleaccount
```

By default the private key will be located in `/var/tmp/SECRET_KEY.txt`
make sure to delete this key as soon as you has configured it in your CI!

If you lose the key, nothing to worry about, simply remove the admin again.

```console
bash$ blackbox_removeadmin travis-ci@roleaccount
bash$ blackbox_update_all_files
```

!!! danger "Note!"
    If one of your secret keys is exposed in a leak for
    a public git repository, removing the admin from the current version will
    do no good. As an attacker could simply clone a old version of your repository
    and read those secrets. So in the worst case you have to delete your
    old encrypted files from the complete git history. Which, for open source
    projects cloned and forked is pretty much impossible. So you still have to
    protect your private keys!

# Configure your CI

## Travis CI

First create a new role account for travis as outlined in the previous chapter.

Unfortunately for travis we can't simply use an encrypted variable, because
the private key is too large. So we have to use **encrypted files**.

!!! warning ""
    Travis only allows a single encrypted file. But this shouldn't be a problem,
    simply store the private key for blackbox as a travis encrypted file,
    and everything else inside blackbox.

```console
mv /var/tmp/SECRET_KEY.txt .travis.blackbox.key
travis encrypt-file --pro .travis.blackbox.key --add
```

!!! note "Arguments"
    * `--pro` use travis.com (instead of travis.org)
    * `--add` Immediately save to `.travis.yml`

The above command will:

1. create a file called `.travis.blackbox.key.enc`
2. add a line to your `before_install` section of your `travis.yml` like:
    ```yaml
   - openssl aes-256-cbc -K $encrypted_83630750896a_key -iv $encrypted_83630750896a_iv
       -in .travis.blackbox.key.enc -out .travis.blackbox.key -d
   ```

All that is left to do is download the blackbox binary and call `cipostdeploy`.
Your `travis.yml` should look like:

```yaml
dist: xenial
# [...]
before_install:
  # autogenerated openssl decrypt line
  - openssl aes-256-cbc -K $encrypted_83630750896a_key -iv $encrypted_83630750896a_iv
      -in .travis.blackbox.key.enc -out .travis.blackbox.key -d
  # Download blackbox, run cipostdeploy
  - curl -O blackbox.go.linux.amd64 https://github.com/hpoul/blackbox/releases/download/golang-v0.1-cipostdeploy/blackbox.go.linux.amd64
  - chmod +x blackbox.go.linux.amd64
  - ./blackbox.go.linux.amd64 cipostdeploy < .travis.blackbox.key
```

Now make sure you commit `travis.yml` **and** `.travis.blackbox.key.enc` into
git. (Make sure it is the encrypted `.enc` file you are committing).

🎉️ and you should be done. Travis should now easily decrypt the blackbox
private key and then decrypt all your secrets stored in blackbox.

## Cirrus CI

Cirrus CI is almost the same as travis, but easier because you do not need
an ecrypted file, but we can use an [encrypted environment variable][5].

Head to your repository main page (for example:
`https://cirrus-ci.com/github/my-organization/my-repository`) and click
on the *Settings* icon. There you can encrypted an environment variable.
Simply paste the whole contents of the private key for blackbox into
the field and hit **ENCRYPT**. The result will be something like:

```
ENCRYPTED[d2f1f20235d7abe3e22783f723700e11b0aa60733009d8f7aa15d9fc0ba5c01c09094720016c46d1136345df357e1ab0]
```

This value can now be added to your `.cirrus.yml` file:

```yaml
osx_instance:
  image: mojave-xcode-10.2

task:
  environment:
    BLACKBOX_SECRET_KEY: ENCRYPTED[d2f1f20235d7abe3e22783f723700e11b0aa60733009d8f7aa15d9fc0ba5c01c09094720016c46d1136345df357e1ab0]
  install_script:
  - curl -O blackbox.go.macos https://github.com/hpoul/blackbox/releases/download/golang-v0.1-cipostdeploy/blackbox.go.macos
  - chmod +x blackbox.go.macos
  - echo "$BLACKBOX_SECRET_KEY" | ./blackbox.go.macos cipostdeploy

```

🎉️ and you should be done. ;-)

## GitLab CI

Especially since GitLab 11.11 storing the encryption key for blackbox
is particularly easy thanks to **variable types**. (See also the 
[documentation provided by gitlab][6]). We can simply create a secret
variable which will be stored into a file. As with Cirrus CI copy and paste
the whole contents of the secret key file into the text field. Make sure to
select variable type `File` and choose a matching key 
like `BLACKBOX_SECRET_KEY`.

{{render content=node.embed.figures.gitlab /}}

Now we can simply pass this file along to `blackbox cipostdeploy`.

**.gitlab-ci.yml**

```yaml
# [...]
before_script:
  - curl -O blackbox.go.linux.amd64 https://github.com/hpoul/blackbox/releases/download/golang-v0.1-cipostdeploy/blackbox.go.linux.amd64
  - chmod +x blackbox.go.linux.amd64
  - ./blackbox.go.linux.amd64 cipostdeploy "$BLACKBOX_SECRET_KEY"
```

# Conclusion

As you can see it is very straight forward to use blackbox in your CI 
process, it all boils down to three easy steps:

1. Create Role Private/Public key pair for CI
2. Store the private key as a secret variable with your CI
3. Use this secret variable to decrypt blackbox files using `cipostdeploy`

!!! question "What do you think?"
    Have you successfully configured your CI? Did you run into problems?
